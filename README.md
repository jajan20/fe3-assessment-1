## Assesment
Create a chart using a dataset with D3.js V4.

## Workflow
1. Checking which dataset I want to use.
2. Research which chart is best used for the data.
3. Look for a base source code to work on.
4. Implement the data so it is understandable.
5. Use css styling to make it more appealing.

## Process

I first started with a different chart, by due time issues and my understanding of D3js I used something different.
V3 and V4 really have some big differences it took me some time to figure these out.

## Review

I'm especially proud about the fact that I figured a lot of things out in such a short time.
Although I'm sure I could've develiverd a better product if I had more time.
